# Dog Breed Identification

In this project, I've created a feature extraction model for Dog Breed Identification and then fine tuned the model. It is Live on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rafayqayyum/IdentifyDogBreed)

## About Dataset
The dataset used here is from [Stanford_dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) which is avaiable on tensorflow datasets.

## About files
* helper_functions.py contains helper functions used in the main notebook
* dog_breed_identification is a jupyter notebook in which the EfficientNetV2B3 model is used for feature extraction and fine tuning.
* fine_tuned.h5 is a saved fine tuned model.
